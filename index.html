                    Growing up in Florida, my earliest memories are of watching launches from my front yard and the wonder they filled me with as I witnessed them break the holds of gravity and leave our planet. This wonder was what drove me to create Launch360 in 2018. Covering spaceflight and interacting with the incredible space community over these last couple of years has been the most fun and fulfilling project I've ever had the pleasure of working on. Despite Launch360 being primarily a one-person operation, my peers and the community's overwhelming support kept me going and continuously looking for ways to improve the platform.

                    However, with my graduation came unforeseen hardship as the COVID-19 pandemic began. The world went into lockdown, and everyone's lives were put on hold. During that critical time, I felt it would be in my best interest to focus solely on the start of my career. So, in 2020, Launch360 entered a state of limbo and was put on indefinite hiatus.

                    I am excited to announce that I have accepted a position supporting NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humanity to the Moon and, eventually, explore Mars. As I start this new chapter in my life, it is only fitting that I give the previous proper closure.

                    With that, Launch360 is now officially offline. All Launch360-specific social media will now be taken down, including our Facebook page. However, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/launch360">Launch360 YouTube channel</a> will remain up so that the community can still enjoy our existing virtual reality launch experiences.
